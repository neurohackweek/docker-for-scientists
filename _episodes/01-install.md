### Docker installation

Before we begin, we need to install Docker!

- [Windows](https://neurohackademy2020.slack.com/archives/C017PCJS63X/p1595694888002500)
- [Mac OS X](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
- [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/)


### When it's finished
Before running containers you need to give Docker acces too you locla hard drives. This can be enabled in Settings->Shared Drives.
When your installation is completed open a terminal (console/cmd) and type:

`docker pull bids/base_fsl`
